# CSCI355 Internet and Web Technologies



This is the Final Project for 355 <P>
  In this project I use 2 different API which is weather API with API Key and COVID API<p>
  When you run the javascript code you open html page where you enter City Name then press enter <p>
  It then returns the current weather for that city and daily covid numbers from 5 different country
